Dressed as iconic Dravidian leaders, our children don't just put on costumes; they step into a rich tapestry of experiences. Each outfit is a portal to an era of transformation, and each character they embody carries a message that has resonated through time. As they enact stories of resilience, courage, and change, they don't just entertain â€“ they educate and inspire.
