Founded on November 13, 1994, in Chicago, Illinois, Periyar International was inaugurated by Hon. Chandrajit Yadav, with Dr. K. Veeramani, President of Dravidar Kazhagam, in attendance. The organization began with three directors: Dr. Soma Ilangovan, Mr. V.J. Babu, and Dr. Thembavani Gopalakrishnan. Periyar International now supports the formation of country-specific chapters, operating under local regulations with the approval of Dravidar Kazhagam and our operational director.
